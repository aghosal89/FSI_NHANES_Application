	abstract = {Physical activity improves quality of life, physical health and mental health, and is also an important protective factor against highly prevalent age-related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer and mental health. With age, physical activity tends to decrease, leading down a vicious cycle that increases vulnerability to disease in the elderly. In the following, we trained neural network architectures to predict age from 115,456 one week-long 100Hz wrist accelerometer recordings from the UK Biobank (R-Squared=63.5{\textpm}2.4\%; root mean squared error=4.7{\textpm}0.1 years). We achieved this performance by preprocessing the raw data as 2,271 scalar features, 113 time series and four images. We also considered the raw signal at different time scales (weekly activity patterns vs. gait). We then defined accelerated aging for a participant as being predicted older than one{\textquoteright}s actual age and aimed to characterize these participants. We performed a genome wide association on the accelerated aging phenotypes to estimate its heritability (h_g2=12.3{\textpm}0.9\%) and identified nine single nucleotide polymorphisms in seven genes associated with it (e.g HIST1H4L, involved in chromatin organization). Similarly, we identified biomarkers (e.g blood pressure), clinical phenotypes (e.g chest pain), diseases (e.g hypertension), environmental (e.g smoking) and socioeconomic (e.g income and education) variables associated with accelerated aging. We conclude that physical activity-derived biological age is a complex phenotype with both genetic and non-genetic factors.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding: NIEHS R00 ES023504; NIEHS R21 ES25052; NIAID R01 AI127250; NSF 163870; MassCATS, Massachusetts Life Science Center; Sanofi.

abstract={Purpose This study aimed to present age- and sex-specific percentiles for daily wrist-worn movement metrics in US youth and adults. This metric represents a summary of all recorded movement, regardless of the purpose, context, or intensity. Methods  Wrist-worn accelerometer data from the combined 2011--2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles and the 2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey National Youth Fitness Survey were used for this analysis. Monitor-Independent Movement Summary units (MIMS-units) from raw triaxial accelerometer data were used. We removed the partial first and last assessment days and days with ≥5{\%} nonwear time. Participants with ≥1 valid day were included. Mean MIMS-units were calculated across all valid days. Percentile tables and smoothed curves of daily MIMS-units were calculated for each age and sex using the Generalized Additive Models for Location Shape and Scale. Results  The analytical sample included 14,705 participants age ≥3 yr. The MIMS-unit activity among youth was similar for both sexes, whereas adult females generally had higher MIMS-unit activity than did males. Median daily MIMS-units peaked at age 6 yr for both sexes (males, 20,613; females, 20,706). Lowest activity was observed for males and females 80+ yr of age: 8799 and 9503, respectively. Conclusions  Population referenced MIMS-unit percentiles for US youth and adults are a novel means of characterizing total activity volume. By using MIMS-units, we provide a standardized reference that can be applied across various wrist-worn accelerometer devices. Further work is needed to link these metrics to activity intensity categories and health outcomes.},
